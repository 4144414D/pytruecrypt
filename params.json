See the examples, and pytruecrypt.py - the comments show how to use it.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE USAGE:  \r\n\r\nUse -h for a hidden volume\r\n\r\n\tmount.py [-h] volumename dmname\r\n\r\n\tpwcrack.py [-h] volumename wordlist\r\n\r\n\tdump.py [-h] volumename\r\n  \r\nExample capabilities:  \r\n\r\n\tHEADER ------------  \r\n\tMagic : TRUE  \r\n\tHdrVersion : 5  \r\n\tMinProgVer : 7  \r\n\tCRC : 478393955  \r\n\tReserved :   \r\n\tHiddenVolSize : 0  \r\n\tVolSize : 4980736  \r\n\tDataStart : 131072  \r\n\tDataSize : 4980736  \r\n\tFlags : 0  \r\n\tSectorSize : 512  \r\n\tReserved2 :   \r\n\tCRC3 : 1731532461  \r\n\tKeys : 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  \r\n\r\n\tFIRST SECTOR-------  \r\n\t0000  eb 3c 90 4d 53 44 4f 53 35 2e 30 00 02 02 02 00   .<.MSDOS5.0.....  \r\n\t0010  02 00 02 00 26 f8 13 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 00 00   ....&...........  \r\n\t0020  00 00 00 00 00 00 29 18 d5 1e 7d 4e 4f 20 4e 41   ......)...}NO NA  \r\n\t0030  4d 45 20 20 20 20 46 41 54 31 36 20 20 20 00 00   ME    FAT16   ..  \r\n\t0040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0050  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0060  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0070  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0080  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0090  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t00a0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t00b0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t00c0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t00d0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t00e0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t00f0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0100  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0110  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0120  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0130  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0140  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0150  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0160  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0170  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0180  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t0190  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t01a0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t01b0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t01c0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t01d0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t01e0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................  \r\n\t01f0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 55 aa   ..............U.  \r\n\t  \r\n\t0 9728 crypt aes-xts-plain64 9957787da1014346895b4fc2ceafe00727819694f049b4fb9c74fae99e087312342f456f9db596a79bf8ef1dd46d542c0084ad9a1ebed3c1903ec96e59b2fc1d 256 /dev/loop0 256  \r\n\tTcryptdevice on /dev/mapper/tcrypt - you may now mount it  \r\n\t  \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
