It also works with hidden volumes if given the -h option. \r\n\r\n    > dump <container>\r\n    > dump example.tc\r\n    > Enter password: password\r\n\t\r\n    HEADER RAW ----------\r\n    0000  54

..............U.\r\n\r\n####image.py\r\nimage is used to image a truecrypt container for further analysis. The container can be open with a password or with keys extracted from memory.\r\n\r\nEncryption modes can be assigned long or short hand where:\r\n\r\n    aes      = a\r\n    twofish  = t\r\n    serpent  = s\r\n\r\nFor example 'aes-twofish' can be shortened to 'at' and aes-twofish-serpent \r\nto ats. \r\n\r\nSimilarly hash functions can be assigned long or short hand where:\r\n\r\n    ripemd    = r\r\n    sha-512   = s\r\n    whirlpool = w\r\n\r\n#####Example usage:\r\n\r\n    > image pwd <tc> <image> <mode> <password> [<hash>] [-vbh] [(-f -oBYTES -dBYTES)]\r\n    > image key <tc> <image> <mode> [-aKEY -tKEY -sKEY] [(-oBYTES -dBYTES)]\r\n\r\n######Scenario 1:\r\nYou wish to image a TrueCrypt file \"input1.tc\" to an image named \"output1.dd\", \r\nit uses aes and ripemd. The password is \"Scenario1\". As ripemd is the default\r\nfor TrueCrypt it does not need to be specified.\r\n\r\n    > image pwd input1.tc output1.dd aes Scenario1 \r\n\r\n######Scenario 2:\r\nYou wish to image a TrueCrypt file \"input2.tc\" to an image named \"output2.dd\",\r\nit uses aes-serpent and sha512. The password is \"Scenario2\". You wish to save \r\ntime and use the short hand commands.\r\n\r\n    > image pwd input2.tc output2.dd as Scenario2 s\r\n\r\n######Scenario 3:\r\nYou wish to image a TrueCrypt file \"input3.tc\" to an image named \"output3.dd\",\r\nit uses aes-serpent. You know it contains a hidden volume and the password is \r\n\"Scenario3\".\r\n\r\n    > image pwd input3.tc output3.dd aes-serpent Scenario3 --hidden\r\n\r\n######Scenario 4:\r\nYou wish to image a TrueCrypt file \"input4.tc\" to an image named \"output4.dd\",\r\nit uses aes. You do not know the password but have extracted AES keys from \r\nmemory. \r\n\r\n    > image key input4.tc output4.dd aes --aes bac01155a46547f00c3ddf9a4a765159fbe\r\n    1f68d94bf11a3bd6910eedf26d867a63263c949812cd68b7dad91a8dfdacb96942b93cc1b21ffa\r\n    feeb4791a0befa4\r\n\r\n\r\n####pw-check.py\r\npw-check.py is used to check that a small list of passwords work against a container. It checks all options available in Truecrypt and allows you to confirm that normal and backup headers match. The -d option will print the decoded header to screen if successful, the -v option will also read Veracrypt files.  \r\n\r\n    > pw-check <container> <password>\r\n    > pw-check example.tc password\r\n\tpassword appears to be valid for a TrueCrypt standard volume using the normal header using aes and ripemd\r\n\tpassword appears to be valid for a TrueCrypt standard volume using the backup header using aes and ripemd\r\n\r\n####pwcracker.py\r\npwcracker.py is an example password cracker for Truecrypt. Simply provide a word list and it will attempt to crack the container.\r\n\r\n    > pwcracker <container> <wordlist>\r\n    > pwcracker example.tc wordlist.txt\r\n    > PW Found: password\r\n\r\n####quick-container.py\r\nquick-container.py produces a Truecrypt container quickly by skipping the first stage encryption setting. This is therefore similar to 'quick format' full disk encryption whereby the free space is not first encrypted. This means a hidden volume is very obvious and it's possible to track the ammount of encrypted data stored within a container. \r\n\r\nThe containers are not formatted and once mounted will require a file system to be created. Containers are always created using AES and ripemd. \r\n\r\n    > quick-container <container> <password> <mb-size>\r\n    > quick-container example password 1024\r\n\t\r\n####reserved.py\r\nreserved.py uses the free space in the Truecrypt header to hide additional data. This data is encrypted with the same password as the container itself. \r\n\r\nTo hide a file:\r\n\r\n    > reserved hide <container> <password> <file>\r\n    > reserved hide example.tc password secret.txt\r\n\t\r\nTo read a hidden file:\r\n\r\n    > reserved check <container> <password>\r\n    > reserved check example.tc password\r\n    > My secret file...\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n-------------\r\nYou must have pycryptoplus installed - https://github.com/doegox/python-cryptoplus\r\nFor many examples you must have docopt installed - http://docopt.org/\r\n  \r\nTruecrypt Documentation:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nVery little as the code is generally compact. See the examples, and pytruecrypt.py - the comments show how to use it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
