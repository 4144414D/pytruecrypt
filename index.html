<p>Truecrypt volume parsing library by originally created by <a href="https://github.com/drgowen/">Gareth Owen</a>, University of Portsmouth, with additional features added by <a href="https://github.com/4144414d/">Adam Swann</a>.</p>

<p>Library status:</p>

<ul>
<li>Decrypts header (can dump raw decrypted header)</li>
<li>Decodes header fields</li>
<li>Can dump any decrypted sector</li>
<li>Hidden volume support</li>
<li>Veracrypt support</li>
<li>Can decrypt using only recovered keys (no password required)</li>
<li>Supports all encryption modes and hash functions offered by Truecrypt</li>
<li>Can decrypt damaged containers if salt and header keys are recoverable </li>
<li>Easy to use - see example and source code for API</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>dump.py: Header and first sector decrypted hex dump</li>
<li>image.py: Create decrypted dd image of container</li>
<li>pw-check.py: Checks password against all available Truecrypt options</li>
<li>pwcracker.py: Password cracker</li>
<li>quick-container.py: Produces a working Truecrypt container in seconds</li>
<li>reserved.py: Hides data within the reserved space of a container</li>
</ul>

<a id="example-usage" class="anchor" href="#example-usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example Usage</h2>

<p>Below are examples on how to use the example scripts.</p>

<h4>
<a id="dumppy" class="anchor" href="#dumppy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>dump.py</h4>

<p>dump.py will perform a hex dump of the decrypted header and first sector of a container. It also works with hidden volumes if given the -h option. </p>

<a id="imagepy" class="anchor" href="#imagepy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>image.py</h4>

<p>image is used to image a Truecrypt container for further analysis. The container can be open with a password or with keys extracted from memory.</p>

<p>Encryption modes can be assigned long or short hand where:</p>

<pre><code>aes      = a
twofish  = t
serpent  = s
</code></pre>

<p>For example 'aes-twofish' can be shortened to 'at' and aes-twofish-serpent 
to ats. </p>

<p>Similarly hash functions can be assigned long or short hand where:</p>

<pre><code>ripemd    = r
sha-512   = s
whirlpool = w
</code></pre>

<p>You wish to image a Truecrypt file "input1.tc" to an image named "output1.dd", 
it uses aes and ripemd. The password is "Scenario1". As ripemd is the default
for Truecrypt it does not need to be specified.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; image pwd input1.tc output1.dd aes Scenario1

<h4>
<a id="pw-checkpy" class="anchor" href="#pw-checkpy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>pw-check.py</h4>

<p>pw-check.py is used to check that a small list of passwords work against a container. It checks all options available in Truecrypt and allows you to confirm that normal and backup headers match. The -d option will print the decoded header to screen if successful, the -v option will also read Veracrypt files.  </p>

<pre><code>&gt; pw-check &lt;container&gt; &lt;password&gt;

<h4>
<a id="pwcrackerpy" class="anchor" href="#pwcrackerpy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>pwcracker.py</h4>

<p>pwcracker.py is an example password cracker for Truecrypt. Simply provide a word list and it will attempt to crack the container.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; pwcracker &lt;container&gt; &lt;wordlist&gt;
&gt; pwcracker example.tc wordlist.txt
&gt; PW Found: password
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a id="quick-containerpy" class="anchor" href="#quick-containerpy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>quick-container.py</h4>

<p>quick-container.py produces a Truecrypt container quickly by skipping the first stage encryption setting. This is therefore similar to 'quick format' full disk encryption whereby the free space is not first encrypted. This means a hidden volume is very obvious and it's possible to track the ammount of encrypted data stored within a container. </p>

<p>The containers are not formatted and once mounted will require a file system to be created. Containers are always created using AES and ripemd. </p>

<pre><code>&gt; quick-container &lt;container&gt; &lt;password&gt; &lt;mb-size&gt;
&gt; quick-container example password 1024
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a id="reservedpy" class="anchor" href="#reservedpy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>reserved.py</h4>

<p>reserved.py uses the free space in the Truecrypt header to hide additional data. This data is encrypted with the same password as the container itself. </p>

<p>To hide a file:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; reserved hide &lt;container&gt; &lt;password&gt; &lt;file&gt;
&gt; reserved hide example.tc password secret.txt
</code></pre>

<p>To read a hidden file:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; reserved check &lt;container&gt; &lt;password&gt;
&gt; reserved check example.tc password
&gt; My secret file...
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="truecrypt-documentation" class="anchor" href="#truecrypt-documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Truecrypt Documentation:</h2>

<p>Very little as the code is generally compact. See the examples, and pyTruecrypt.py - the comments show how to use it. I am slowly expanding this section. </p>

<h3>
<a id="truecrypt-basics" class="anchor" href="#truecrypt-basics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Truecrypt Basics</h3>

<p>Truecrypt works in two main ways either as full disk encryption or using
encrypted containers on Windows, Linux, or OSX. On windows it is also
possible to encrypt the operating system with Truecrypt and boot into
windows. This is not possible on Linux or OSX but it can still use full
disk encryption on non OS disks.</p>

<h3>
<a id="algorithms" class="anchor" href="#algorithms" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithms</h3>

<p>Truecrypt allows the following encryption schemes all working in XTS
mode. Where more than one encryption algorithm is used the data is
encrypted with each algorithm using different master keys.</p>

<ul>
<li>AES (default)</li>
<li>Serpent</li>
<li>Twofish</li>
<li>AES - Twofish</li>
<li>AES - Twofish - Serpent</li>
<li>Serpent - AES</li>
<li>Serpent - Twofish - AES</li>
</ul>

<p>Three hash algorithms are available, these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>RIPEMD (default)</li>
<li>SHA-512</li>
<li>WHIRLPOOL</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="encryption-in-truecrypt" class="anchor" href="#encryption-in-truecrypt" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Encryption in Truecrypt</h3>

<p>Truecrypt uses each of the different encryption algorithms in XTS mode.
In short this means that same plain text data encrypted with the same
key but in a different location will produce a different cipher text.
For example a completely zeroed disk encrypted with XTS mode would look
completely random, each sector of zeros produces a different sector of
encrypted data. If ECB mode was used instead you would see a repeating
pattern where each sector of zeros produced the same sector of encrypted
data.</p>

<p>Truecrypt stores the master keys within the Truecrypt header and these
keys are not generated based on the password chosen for the container.
Instead the master keys are generated randomly when the container is
created and stored in the header, the header is then encrypted using the
password provided for by the user. Only by knowing the password to the
header can you successfully decrypt the header and get to the master
keys to decrypt the data.</p>

<p>This allows the user to change the password to a container. Rather then
needing to re-encrypt the whole container only the headers need to be
re-encrypted with the new password, the master keys remain the same.</p>

<p>This raises the obvious risk, if an attacker can decrypt the header at
any point in time they can use the master keys to decrypt data. I.E. A
container is created with a simple password, the attacker cracks this 
password and stores the master keys. Later the users changes the password
to the container in an effort to increase security, however the attacker 
already has the master keys and as such can decrypt the container. </p>

<h3>
<a id="volumes" class="anchor" href="#volumes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Volumes</h3>

<p>TrueCrypt allows the user to have a normal volume and a hidden volume.
The normal volume is designed to be well encrypted but if the TrueCrypt
volume is detected you would not be able to plausibly deny its
existence, and so rubber hose cryptanalysis could be used to get the
password from you. The hidden volume on the other hand is designed to
hide within the normal volume and would look like any other section of
random data, allowing you to plausibly deny it being there.</p>

<p>The layout of a container is shown in below. The first 256 sectors store 
the main headers, while the last 256 sectors store the backup headers 
should the main headers be damaged. Everything in-between is the data 
section of the container and will store the actual user data.</p>

<p>Almost everything within the container is encrypted so normal analysis
of the file will simply show ‘random’ data. Only the salts for each of
the headers are store in a decrypted form, however these are simply 64
bits of random data so should be impossible to tell them apart.</p>

<p>The normal and backup headers contain the same decrypted data however
they are encrypted with different salts. This means they will appear to
be completely different on the binary level.</p>

<p>The space in the headers (254 sectors in total) is seeded with random
data when the container is first created. This is one of the main
reasons it’s difficult to detect a hidden volume, with or without one
this sector will seemingly contain random data.</p>

<h3>
<a id="truecrypt-header-v5" class="anchor" href="#truecrypt-header-v5" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Truecrypt Header v5</h3>

<p>Truecrypt 7.1a uses the header version 5. This header is the same for
normal and hidden volumes and system encryption, the difference is
simply their location and flag bits.</p>

<h4>
<a id="header-elements" class="anchor" href="#header-elements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Header Elements</h4>

<p><strong>1)  Salt - 64 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>The salt is used when encrypting the header. This is randomly generated data and so will look as if it’s encrypted.</p>

<p><strong>2)  File Signature - 4 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>The ASCII string ‘TRUE’. This is used to check if the header has been decrypted correctly.</p>

<p><strong>3)  Header Version - 2 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>The version of Truecrypt header in use, for 7.1a this will always be \x00\x05.</p>

<p><strong>4)  Truecrypt Version - 2 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>The minimum version of Truecrypt needed to use the volume. For 7.1a this is always be <a href="x00x07">\x00\x07</a>.</p>

<p><strong>5)  Key CRC - 4 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>CRC32 value for the bytes 256-511 of the header. I.E. the master keys. This is also used to confirm if the Truecrypt header has been decrypted correctly.</p>

<p><strong>6)  Reserved Space - 16 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>16 Bytes of \x00 which aren’t used in the header.</p>

<p><strong>7)  Size of Hidden Volume - 8 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>The size in bytes of the hidden volume. This is set to zero in a non-hidden volume.</p>

<p><strong>8)  Size of Hidden Volume - 8 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>The size in bytes of the volume.</p>

<p><strong>9)  Offset to Data - 8 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>The is the byte offset from the start of the data. If this header is for a normal (non-hidden) container this should be \x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00. This is 131072 bytes, or sector 256.</p>

<p><strong>10) Size of Data - 8 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>The total size in bytes of the data portion of the container.</p>

<p><strong>11) Flag Bits - 4 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>Used to determine what type of container is in use. Bit 0 is set for system encryption, while bit 1 is set for non-system in place encryption. The other bits are not used.</p>

<p><strong>12) Reserved Space - 120 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>Further space in the header which isn’t used.</p>

<p><strong>13) Header CRC - 4 Bytes</strong></p>

<p>A CRC32 value for the bytes 64-251 of the header.</p>

<p><strong>14) Master Keys - 32 Bytes each</strong></p>

<p>The remaining space is devoted to the master keys. If multiple encryption algorithms are used then multiple keys will be present. Each 'master key' is comprised of 2 separate 128-bit keys for XTS.</p>
