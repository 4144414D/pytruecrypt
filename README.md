pytruecrypt
===========
  
Truecrypt volume parsing library by Gareth Owen, University of Portsmouth  
  
Current status: 
- Decrypts header (can dump raw decrypted header)
- Decodes header fields
- Can dump any decrypted sector
- Hidden volume support
- Easy to use - see example and source code for API

Examples:
- Mounts volume on linux using device mapper
- Password cracker
- Header and sector decrypted hex dump

TODO: 
- add more options  

PREREQUISITES:
You must have pycrypto installed (python-pycryptopp on most distros)
  
DOCUMENTATION:

Very little as the code is compact. See the example, and pytruecrypt.py - the comments show how to use it.

EXAMPLE USAGE:  
  
See examples - they take tcrypt volume as only argument
